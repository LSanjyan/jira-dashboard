# Project Title

Jira-dashboard(reflection)

# Introduction

Users can see dashboard which includes charts of reports, activities, website traffic and so on...

# Functionality Descriptions

The dashboard includes a left-side navigation menu that can be opened and closed. The first three items in the navigation menu have dropdown features.
There is a search bar, and when you hover over it, a tooltip will display to explain its function. Similarly, when you hover over the search icon, it will show what it does.
The dashboard also features notifications, messages, and profile options. When you click on them, a dropdown menu appears, providing additional details.
In the main dashboard area, there are charts, each with a filter feature that appears as a mini dropdown menu.
When you scroll down, a blue button appears at the bottom right of the screen. Clicking this button will navigate you back to the top.
The web app is designed for large screen sizes but is fully responsive on smaller screens, such as mobile devices.
